		<div class="inline"><h4>How to Change a Beneficiary:</h4><p>The Owner may change the Beneficiary by filing a written notice with Us.	A change of Beneficiary will not be effective until We record it at Our Administrative Office.	When recorded, even if You are not then living, the change will take effect on the date the notice was signed.	Any proceeds paid before We record a change of Beneficiary will not be subject to change. An irrevocable Beneficiary may not be changed without that Beneficiary's written consent.</p></div>

		<h2>Payment Of Proceeds</h2>
		<p>Upon receipt of due proof of Your death while this Policy is in force, We will pay the proceeds.	Due proof of death means a certified copy of Your death certificate or other lawful evidence providing equivalent information and proof of the claimant’s interest in the proceeds.	The proceeds will equal the Face Amount shown on the Policy Schedule plus any insurance on Your life provided by Riders plus the portion of any Premium actually paid that applies to a period beyond the date of Your death, less any due and unpaid premium which applies to a period prior to Your death.</p>
		<p>Interest will accrue and be payable on the proceeds from the date of death to the date of payment at the rate of 3% per annum.	Additional interest, at a rate of 10% will be added if the proceeds are not paid within 31 calendar days from the latest of:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Our receipt of due proof of Your death;</li>
			<li>Our receipt of sufficient information to determine the extent of liability and the payee; and</li>
			<li>Removal of any legal impediments to payment of proceeds that were dependent upon parties other than Us.</li>

		<h2>General Provisions</h2>

		<div class="inline"><h4>Conformity With IIPRC Standards:</h4><p>This Policy was approved under the authority of the Interstate Insurance Product Regulation Commission (IIPRC) and issued under the IIPRC standards.	Any provision of this Policy that on the provision’s effective date is in conflict with the IIPRC standards for this product type is hereby amended to conform to the IIPRC standards for this product type as of the provision’s effective date.</p></div>
		<div class="inline"><h4>Incontestability of the Policy:</h4><p>We cannot contest this Policy after it has been in force during Your lifetime for two years from the Policy Date, except for the nonpayment of Premiums.	If this Policy is reinstated, this provision will be measured from the reinstatement date and any contest will be based only on the statements in the reinstatement application.	This provision does not apply to any Rider providing benefits specifically for disability or death by accident. Any contest to this Policy must be based on a statement contained in the application and attached to this Policy and which is material to the risk accepted or the hazard assumed by the Company.</p></div>
		<div class="inline"><h4>Amount Payable is Limited in the Event of Suicide:</h4><p>If You die by suicide within two years from the Policy Date or the date of reinstatement, Our liability will be limited to the amount of Premiums paid.</p></div>
		<div class="inline"><h4>Misstatement of Age or Sex in the Application:</h4><p>If Your age or sex has been misstated, We will pay the amount of insurance that the Premiums would have purchased had Your age and sex been correctly stated.</p></div>
		<div class="inline"><h4>Misstatement of Tobacco Use in The Application:</h4><p>If Your tobacco use status has been misstated, We will provide during the first two years from the Policy Date for an adjustment due to such misstatement.	The amount payable on death will be the amount that the Premium would have purchased using the correct tobacco use status.</p></div>
		<div class="inline"><h4>The Contract Consists of this Policy and the Application:</h4><p>We have issued this Policy based on the application and payment of the Premiums.	A copy of the application is attached and is a part of this Policy.	This Policy with the application and any attached riders or endorsements makes the entire contract.	All statements in the application in the absence of fraud are considered representations and not warranties.</p></div>
		<div class="inline"><h4>Policy Changes:</h4><p>Changes in this Policy may only be made by:</p></div>
		<ul>
			<li>An endorsement signed by one of Our officers; or</li>
			<li>A Rider signed by one of Our officers.</li>
			<li>No agent has the authority to change this Policy in any way.</li>
		</ul>
		<div class="inline"><h4>Owner of the Policy:</h4><p>You are the Owner of this Policy unless a different Owner is stated in the application.	If a different Owner is stated, such designation will remain in effect until the Owner changes it.	If the Owner dies before You, the ownership rights belong to his or her estate.	During Your lifetime, only the Owner will be entitled to the rights granted by this Policy.</p></div>
		<p>The Owner can transfer ownership to a new Owner by filing a written request for change with the Company.	The change of ownership will take effect as of the date the request was signed, unless otherwise specified by the Owner, but without any liability to Us on account of any payment We made or action We took before the request was received by Us.	We are not responsible for the validity of a transfer of ownership.</p>
		<div class="inline"><h4>Assignment of the Policy:</h4><p>This Policy may be assigned.	We are not responsible for the validity of any assignment.	The assignment must be filed with Us in duplicate at Our Administrative Office. The Owner's rights and those of any irrevocable Beneficiary will be subject to it effective on the date the notice of assignment is signed by the Owner, subject to any action taken by Us before We receive it.</p></div>
		<div class="inline"><h4>Nonparticipation:</h4><p>This Policy does not participate in the distribution of Our surplus.	As a result, no dividends will be paid under this Policy.</p></div>
		<div class="inline"><h4>Basis of Reserves:</h4><p>Reserves are calculated based on the 2001 Commissioners Standard Ordinary Mortality Table for the sex and tobacco use of the Insured. A detailed method of computing reserves has been filed with the Interstate Insurance Product Regulation Commission.</p></div>

		<h2>Settlement Options</h2>

		<h3>General Policy Settlement Provisions</h3>
		<div class="inline"><h4>Payee:</h4><p>The Beneficiary is the payee of the Policy proceeds at the Insured's death; any contingent Beneficiary is the contingent payee.	If the Beneficiary is revocable, then the payee is also revocable.</p></div>
		<div class="inline"><h4>Payment Of Policy Proceeds:</h4><p>If the Policy proceeds are less than $5,000, We will pay them to the payee in one sum.	If the Policy proceeds are $5,000 or more, We will pay them to the payee in one sum, unless one of the optional methods of Policy settlement is chosen.</p></div>
		<div class="inline"><h4>Choosing An Optional Method Of Settlement:</h4><p>At any time before the Insured's death, an optional method of Policy settlement may be chosen.	If the Insured dies and an option has not yet been chosen, then the payee may choose an option. We must receive Written Notice informing Us of the option chosen.	If the payee is an executor, administrator, trustee, corporation, partnership or association, the options are available only with Our consent.</p></div>
		<div class="inline"><h4>Frequency Of Payments:</h4><p>If Option 1, 2 or 3 is chosen, We will make payments every 1 year, 6 months, 3 months or 1 month.	The frequency of payments must be specified at the time the option is chosen.	If Option 4 or 5 is chosen, We will make payments every 1 month.	If any payment under an option would be less than $50, We may make payments less frequently so that each payment is at least $50.</p></div>
		<div class="inline"><h4>First Payment:</h4><p>Depending on the frequency of payments specified, the first payment under Option 1 is payable 1 year, 6 months, 3 months or 1 month from the date of the Insured's death.	The first payment under any other option is payable on the date of the Insured's death.</p></div>

		<p>If the amount that could be purchased by a single premium of $1,000 at Our regular annuity rates in effect at the time the first installment is payable is larger than the amount of the first monthly installment for each $1,000 applied under Option 3, 4 or 5, We will pay the larger amount as the benefit under the option.	We will furnish this amount upon request.</p>

		<div class="inline"><h4>Death Of Payee:</h4><p>At the payee's death, We will pay the amounts below in one sum to the payee's estate, unless We are directed otherwise at the time the option is chosen:</p></div>
		<p>Under Option 1, the amount which was left on deposit with Us to accumulate with interest plus any unpaid interest.</p>
		<p>Under Option 2, 3 or 5, the commuted value of the amount payable at the payee's death as provided under the option chosen.	The commuted value will be based on interest at the rate which would have been used to compute the first installment of the installments remaining to be paid at the payee's death.</p>
		<div class="inline"><h4>Protection Against Creditors:</h4><p>Unless provided otherwise at the time an option is chosen, the payee may neither commute, anticipate, assign, alienate nor otherwise encumber any payment under an option.	Payments under any option are exempt from the claims of creditors and from legal process to the extent the law permits.</p></div>
		<div class="inline"><h4>Settlement Agreement:</h4><p>In exchange for this Policy, We will issue a settlement agreement stating the terms of the option chosen.</p></div>
		<div class="inline"><h4>Additional Interest Earnings:</h4><p>We may pay interest earnings beyond those guaranteed in Options 1 and 2.	If We do, We will determine the amount of the additional interest earnings and how they are paid.</p></div>

		<h3>Optional Methods Of Policy Settlement</h3>

		<div class="inline"><h4>Option 1 - Interest Payments:</h4><p>We will hold the Policy proceeds as principal and pay the interest to the payee.	The interest rate will be 3% per year compounded annually.	We will pay the interest every 1 year, 6 months, 3 months or 1 month, as specified at the time this option is chosen.	At the death of the payee, We will make payment as stated in "Death of Payee."</p></div>
		<div class="inline"><h4>Option 2 - Installments Of A Specified Amount:</h4><p>We will pay the Policy proceeds to the payee in equal installments every 1 year, 6 months, 3 months or 1 month.	The amount of the equal installment payments and the frequency of payments must be specified at the time this option is chosen.	After each payment, We will add interest to that portion of the Policy proceeds applied under this option which has not yet been paid as installments.	The interest rate will be 3% per year compounded annually.	Installments will be paid to the payee until the amount applied under this option, including interest, is exhausted.	The total of the installments paid each year must be at least 5% of the proceeds applied under this option.	If the payee dies before the amount applied is exhausted, We will pay the unpaid installments as stated in "Death of Payee."</p></div>
		<div class="inline"><h4>Option 3 - Installments For A Specified Period:</h4><p>We will pay the Policy proceeds in equal installments to the payee for the number of years specified at the time this option is chosen.	Payments will be made every 1 year, 6 months, 3 months or 1 month, as specified at the time this option is chosen.	The amount of the equal installments for each $1,000 applied under this option is shown in the following table.	These amounts are calculated at an interest rate of 3% per year compounded annually.	If the payee dies before the number of years specified ends, We will pay the unpaid installments as stated in "Death of Payee."</p></div>
